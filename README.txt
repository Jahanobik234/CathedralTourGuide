Application Version 1.0 (March 28, 2017)

This deployment of our application has implemented many of the functions and abilities we had hoped for.
Users can search for a room, view their achievements, take quizzes, or study a given room.
At this point in the development, we have only laid out the basic framework for the application.
In other words, we have not added much content yet, in the hopes of perfecting and finalizing the framework
before concerning ourselves with actual images/text/audio.
In the coming deployments, we will focus on the content only after assuring ourselves of the basic infrastructure
of our application. As of now, users can interact with the application and try out some of the content that is present
at this time.

Our application will save data to the users phone (for interactions such as Quizzes and Achievements).

The only area of our application that we have yet to deploy was the navigation drawer containing things like
the help screen. Although we find this very important, we hope that users will be able to navigate through the application
with our well-defined and easy to understand icons. We understand the necessity of this feature and will include it in
following deployments.

Users who experience any problems or difficulties with the application are encouraged to contact us. Your feedback is
always invited as a way to improve our application.
