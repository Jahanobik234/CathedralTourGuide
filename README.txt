Application Version 1.0 (March 28, 2017)

This deployment of our application includes many of the functions and abilities we wanted to implement.
Users can search for a nationality room, view their achievements and current progress, take quizzes to 
test their knowledge and understanding, or study a given room.

Currently, we have only laid out the basic framework for our application. In other words, we missing 
a lot of specific background information pertaining to each nationality room, in the hopes of perfecting 
and finalizing the framework before concerning ourselves with actual images/text/audio.

In the coming deployments, we will focus on the content only after assuring ourselves that the basic infrastructure
of our application is stable and functions as intended. As of now, users can interact with the application 
and try out some of the content that is present at this time. For example, the user is able to retrieve
the information for a room by entering a unique room number or selecting it from the dropdown menu.
The user can also play the sample audio for the African Heritage room, take sample quizzes and check out their
current achievement score. 

Our application will save data to the users phone (for interactions such as Quizzes and Achievements).

The only significant area of our application that we have yet to deploy was the navigation drawer containing things like
the help screen. Although we find this very important, we hope that users will be able to navigate through the application
with our well-defined and easy to understand icons. We understand the necessity of this feature and will include it in
following deployments.

Users who experience any problems or difficulties with the application are encouraged to contact us. Your feedback is
always invited as a way to improve our application!
