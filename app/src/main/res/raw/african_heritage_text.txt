Welcome to the African Heritage room! Upon entering, each guest will find themselves transported to the middle of an Asante temple in Ghana. In this room, carvings play a large part in telling the story to all who come to listen. Almost everything has some sort of illustrative work that symbolizes African's beliefs and contributions in our world. Before taking a seat in one of the agba in the middle of the room, check out the display cases full of artifacts. As you gather in this courtyard, immerse yourself in this collection of cultures.
