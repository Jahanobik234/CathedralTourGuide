The Indian Room looks to represent the value of education in this fascinating land.
This area represents the learning environment for Buddhist monks who come in the hopes of learning all that they can.
Sit down as a pupil or enter the line to give your best wishes to Silabhadra, a scholar among the monks.
Education is so important to this culture, so be sure to read about the decree requiring villages to support the monks looking to learn.
Enter and study with power, courage, and confidence, like the lions of the national emblem above the door.
