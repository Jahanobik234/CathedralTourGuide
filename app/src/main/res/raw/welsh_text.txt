Welcome to the Welsh Room! This chapel is the epicenter of daily life for people in the villages of Wales. In this room, you will be able to find different treasures from a typical Welsh home and place of congregation.
This room has had a long history in the making! Originally proposed during the 1930s, this room finally was completed in the past couple of years. Based on a chapel in a typical Welsh village, this room showcases the types of areas that people met in to practice their beliefs away from English rule. Check out the clock and cabinet towards the back of the room for examples of unique Welsh furnishings.
