	The room as a whole was constructed to encompass the entire continent of Africa, with artifacts and carvings from many of the different countries and tribes. Check out the frieze at the top of the room, which represents the many contributions Africa has made to the world. Visitors alike will feel like they are a tribal ceremony in Ghana when they take a seat in one of the earthen benches around the perimeter of the room. A fun fact about the Asante people is that they consisted of over 5 million people during the 18th century, and had great control over their region. Trading with groups such as the Dutch, British, and Portuguese, the Asante people had riches galore.
