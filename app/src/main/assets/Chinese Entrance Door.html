	The national flower of China, the plum blossom, is carved into the stone door frame. Above the doorway is an inscription with a quote from Confucius reminding us that “Humility of mind goes with loftiness of character.” The Chinese people’s happy outlook on life is reflected in the two laughing lions that guard the entrance. It is also said that if you pat the lion's head and make a wish before you leave it might come true!
