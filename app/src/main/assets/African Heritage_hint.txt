Look High Off The Ground
It's Amazing To Think of Africa's Contributions To Our World
Nobody is above Remedying the Past for the Future
It's an Honor To Be Able To Hold A Meeting in the Courtyard
Every Culture of Africa is "Roped" Together
A High Symbol of Status For a High-Ranking Person
African Groups Have a Great Respect for God
Just Wading By The River...
This Asante Design Shows the Power Dynamic of African Beliefs
