	Confucius, also known as K’ung-Fu-Tze, was born in 551 B.C. in Ch’u Fou, Shantung Province and died in 478 B.C. Confucius was a philosopher and teacher who believed in education for a classless society. He sought to “Teach by inspiring gradually and steadily.” The slate portrait was created by Chinese artist Wu Toi-Tze from a stone engraving imaged from the original in the Confucian temple.
